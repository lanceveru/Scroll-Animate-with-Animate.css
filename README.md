# Scroll-Animate-with-Animate.css
Animate.css library comes with various effects for creating a cool animation to the site and for this I decided to create a script 
that will run the animation to the element with scroll event.

## To use

Add this to the element data-animate="{animation_style}; {offset}"
```html
<span data-animate="bounce;400px"></span>
```
